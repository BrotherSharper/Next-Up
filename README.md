# Combat-Focus

This module will auto focus on the current combatants token at the start of their turn, and pull up its specific actor sheet (only for the GM).
It can close the previous combatants sheet or all opened character sheets


## Upcoming features
- Ability to "pin" actor sheets to prevent closing
