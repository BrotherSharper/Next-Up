# Next-Up

Have you even lost yourself in the mire of 8 actor sheets open at 1 time?
 Do you ever loose track of which mage has spell slots left?
Do you ever run large combats and take 5 seconds each round to find the currently acting token?

### Well Next Up is for you!

This module can:
- Auto focus on the current combatants token at the start of their turn (client setting)
- Pull up its specific actor sheet for the GM.
- Close the previous combatants sheet or all opened character sheets to remove clutter
- Pin specific sheets to the ui to prevent them being closed
